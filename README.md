Practice on bootstrap5 button groups from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a>.

1) Use a <b>div></b> element with class <b>.btn-group</b> to create a button group.

2) Use the class <b>.btn-group-vertical</b> to create a vertical button group.

3) Button groups are <b>"inline"</b> by default, which makes them appear side by side when you have multiple groups.

4) Nest button groups to create dropdown menus <b>(you will learn more about dropdowns in a later chapter)</b>.
